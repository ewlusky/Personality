                The INTP personality type is fairly rare, making up only three percent of the population, which is definitely a good thing
                for them, as there’s nothing they’d be more unhappy about than being "common". INTPs pride themselves on
                their inventiveness and creativity, their unique perspective and vigorous intellect. Usually known as the
                philosopher, the architect, or the dreamy professor, INTPs have been responsible for many scientific discoveries
                throughout history.
